In addition to standard grading/TA positions completed through a PhD program, I have taught university-level economics courses as a full instructor. A course catalog from the University of Oregon's economics department can be found [here](https://catalog.uoregon.edu/courses/crs-ec/)^[Generally speaking, the 1XX -- 6XX course numbers are used to denote courses at the Freshman/ Sophomore/ Junior/ Senior/ Masters/ PhD level, respectively].

Course materials which are not on Github are available upon request.
