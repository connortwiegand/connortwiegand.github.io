### Potential Employers

I am currently looking for full time work in the broad fields of Data Science and Economics. [Check out my resume](/cv/index.qmd) and send me an email (cwiegand-@-uoregon-dot-edu) if you are interested and want to open up a conversation!

### Consulting & Contract Work

If you are in need of a PhD economist -- specifically one who specializes in game theory, behavioral economics, or consumer choice theory -- I am available for consulting work and my rate is negotiable. I'd love to chat, just [send me an email](mailto:cwiegand@ureogon.edu).

Additionally, if you are looking for an economics litigation consultant, my rate is fair, negotiable, and I encourage you to reach out. 

If email is not your preferred mode of communication, [check out my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-wiegand).
