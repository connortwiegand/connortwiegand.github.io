    "text": "I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest (specifically: Bellingham, WA). In addition to regular trips up to Beuatiful British Columbia, I’ve traveled to some really cool places! I’ve been on both coasts of Mexico, visited Banff National Park in Alberta, and experienced some amazing culture in Europe (Spain, France, Italy) as well as the Carribean (Jamaica, Barbados, The Bahamas, Key West).\n\n\n\nWhile in high school, I participated in the Running Start program, which allowed me to get my A.A. degree at the same time while I was in high school. I would highly recommend the Running Start program if it’s available in your state, and would love to chat more about it if you know someone who is interested.\nGetting my associates degree so early allowed me to jump right in to my undergraduate program at the University of Washigton in Seattle. In just three years, I was able to earn a double major in Mathematics and Economics. While there, I took accelerated honors courses in both Real Analysis and Computer Science, attained Honor Roll1 across multiple terms, and took the Core Ph.D. Microeconomics sequence during my last year.\nI am currently at the end of my Ph.D. program at the University of Oregon and am looking to start my career in economics, data science, or tech.\n\n\n\nIn my younger years, I enjoyed playing [video games] and snowboarding at Mt. Baker. I still get around to the former from time to time, but I would love to pick up the latter once my educational career is finished. I’ve also recently resumed playing guitar, which I started in grade school after moving on from the Cello.\nToday, I enjoy playing board games such as Bananagrams and Ticket to Ride and going for walks around my neighborhood with my wife. This year, we began fostering kittens through an amazing local organization in Eugene. When it comes to watching TV, I am a big fan of comedy. Whether it be random trivia, a new programming framework, a language, or a subject I never got around to in school, I simply love to learn new things 2."

The player who is asking for trust can send a message to the other player, and, when AI is present, has the option to interact with ChatGPT to help them send a more convincing signal. When the truster has AI present, the AI helps interpret the message from the trustee, and gives advice on what the truster should do.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Download draft\nRecommended citation: {{ meta r-citation }}\nAbstract:\nDynamic inconsistency in intertemporal choice has long been considered a hallmark of non-exponential discounting. Recent work has challenged this view from a variety of perspectives, including the view that time variance –shifting preferences between measurement dates– can also explain apparent preference reversals. While a nascent literature identifies time-variance and demonstrates its role in explaining time-inconsistency, we lack both a model that allows time-variance to tractably interact with other properties of time preference, and a longitudinal study of sufficient depth to identify such a model. In this paper, we develop the ``nested exponential’’ discount function which is general with respect to time-invariance, time-consistency, and stationarity. The function nests both exponential discounting and a version of present-biased discounting within its parameter space, enabling transparent model selection at both the aggregate and subject levels. We evaluate time-invariance and the performance of the nested exponential model in a 12-week longitudinal study featuring seven surveys. Our elicitations give us unprecedented precision in estimating dynamic inconsistency, non-stationarity, and time-variance. We find that subjects in our study exhibit significant decreasing patience over the course of the study, and that time-variance explains roughly 72% of time-inconsistent choices in our data. This does not mean our data are best-explained by exponential discounting plus preference drift: hyperbolicity is a key feature of our data, and it is well captured by the nested exponential function."
