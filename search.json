    "text": "I am currently at the end of my Ph.D. program at the University of Oregon and am looking to start my career in economics, data science, or tech.\nWhile in high school, I participated in the Running Start program, which allowed me to get my A.A. degree at the same time while I was in high school. I would highly recommend the Running Start program if it’s available in your state, and would love to chat more about it if you know someone who is interested.\nGetting my associates degree so early allowed me to jump right in to my undergraduate program at the University of Washington in Seattle. In just three years, I was able to earn a double major in Mathematics and Economics. While there, I took accelerated honors courses in both Real Analysis and Computer Science, attained Honor Roll1 across multiple terms, and took the Core Ph.D. Microeconomics sequence during my final undergraduate year.\n\n\n\nI was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest (specifically: Bellingham, WA). In addition to regular trips up to British Columbia, I’ve traveled to some really cool places! I’ve been on both coasts of Mexico, visited Banff National Park in Alberta, and experienced some amazing culture in Europe (Spain, France, Italy) as well as the Caribbean (Jamaica, Barbados, The Bahamas, Key West).\n\n\n\nI’ve always enjoyed a wide assortment of games – whether they be video, board, word, etc. Today, that looks like board games such as Bananagrams and Ticket to Ride as well as digital titles like Elden Ring and Baldur’s Gate. I’m also a big fan of Geoguessr and NYT’s Connections. In the past, I’ve had some good runs playing Magic: The Gathering, Team-based and Battle-Royale-style FPSs, platformers from the Mario franchise as well as other Nintendo classics such as Mario Kart, and (like many) Pokemon Go.\nGrowing up in the Pacific Northwest, I value a good hike with nice views. I also enjoy simply going for walks around my neighborhood with my wife and being able to bike to work on weather-permitting days. In my younger years, I loved snowboarding at Mt. Baker, and I would love to pick this pastime up again in the future once my educational career is finished.\nThis year, my wife and I began fostering kittens through an amazing local organization in Eugene. I’ve recently resumed playing guitar, an activity I started in grade school after moving on from the cello. Additionally, I am an avid coffee drinker and so-called “foodie”. Whether it be random trivia, a new programming framework, a language, or a subject I never got around to in school, I simply love to learn new things 2."

An Experimental Study.\" WP.\nAbstract\nIn this study, we experimentally explore the impact of AI as a supportive tool for players in a two-player trust game. The game begins with the trustee sending a message to the trustor. In certain scenarios, the trustee is aided by the large language model (LLM) ChatGPT in composing this message. In other scenarios, the trustor uses AI to interpret the message from the trustee, or both players may have access to AI assistance. Our findings indicate that when the trustee utilizes AI as a helper, it enhances cooperation with the trustor. Interestingly, this improvement in cooperation is not attributed to AI’s superior messaging skills. Instead, when the trustee has AI assistance, it may encourage the trustor to scrutinize the trustee’s message more closely. The detailed scrutiny by the trustor, and potentially the trustee’s awareness of this scrutiny, aligns the beliefs of the trustor and the trustee, thereby fostering an environment that encourages the development of trust.\nFull Paper"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Download Draft \nRecommended citation: Holloway et al. (WP). \"Time-Varying Time Preferences.\" WP.\nAbstract\nDynamic inconsistency in intertemporal choice has long been considered a hallmark of non-exponential discounting. Recent work has challenged this view from a variety of perspectives, including the view that time variance –shifting preferences between measurement dates– can also explain apparent preference reversals. While a nascent literature identifies time-variance and demonstrates its role in explaining time-inconsistency, we lack both a model that allows time-variance to tractably interact with other properties of time preference, and a longitudinal study of sufficient depth to identify such a model. In this paper, we develop the ``nested exponential’’ discount function which is general with respect to time-invariance, time-consistency, and stationarity. The function nests both exponential discounting and a version of present-biased discounting within its parameter space, enabling transparent model selection at both the aggregate and subject levels. We evaluate time-invariance and the performance of the nested exponential model in a 12-week longitudinal study featuring seven surveys. Our elicitations give us unprecedented precision in estimating dynamic inconsistency, non-stationarity, and time-variance. We find that subjects in our study exhibit significant decreasing patience over the course of the study, and that time-variance explains roughly 72% of time-inconsistent choices in our data. This does not mean our data are best-explained by exponential discounting plus preference drift: hyperbolicity is a key feature of our data, and it is well captured by the nested exponential function.\nFull Paper"
